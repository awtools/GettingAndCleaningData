# GettingAndCleaningData
# Course Project
This is my solution for the Coursera Course Project of Getting and Cleaning Data

## Files
- codebook.md         Codebook to understand the variables and the steps done to the data in the run_Analysis.R Script
- run_Analysis.R      the R-Script to get the tidy data from the raw input
- finalData_tidy.txt  Tidy DataSet

## Note
The R-Script run_Analysis.R needs the following condition to run. 
- Donwloaded an unziped data into the directory Getting_and_Cleaning_Data/course_project/UCI HAR Dataset 
- Data from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
